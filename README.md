An Armstrong number of 3 digits is an integer that the sum of the cubes of its digits is  equal to the number

Write a program to check whether an integer is Armstrong number or not.

Example:
371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371


The App should have

● An input field which takes in the number to be checked.
● A button to run a check and a div to display the result. If the number is not a 3

while deactivated, a message should appear explaining why the button can’t be
clicked.
● A div to display the result
